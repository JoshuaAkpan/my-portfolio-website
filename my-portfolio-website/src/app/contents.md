### Implementation Tips:
Hero Section: Use a large font size and bold weight for the hero text to make it stand out. Center the text and provide ample padding around it.
About Section: Use a slightly smaller font size for the about text, with regular weight. Align the text to the left for readability, and use adequate spacing between paragraphs for a clean look.


### Font Recommendation:
Primary Font: Inter - It's modern, clean, and highly readable, making it great for both headers and body text.

Secondary Font: Roboto - It's also very clean and works well with Inter for a harmonious design.

----- Headers and Body Text: Use Inter.
----- Supporting Text or Highlights: Use Roboto.
